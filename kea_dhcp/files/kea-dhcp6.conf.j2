  # Setup reclamation of the expired leases and leases affinity.
  # Expired leases will be reclaimed every 10 seconds. Every 25
  # seconds reclaimed leases, which have expired more than 3600
  # seconds ago, will be removed. The limits for leases reclamation
  # are 100 leases or 250 ms for a single cycle. A warning message
  # will be logged if there are still expired leases in the
  # database after 5 consecutive reclamation cycles.
